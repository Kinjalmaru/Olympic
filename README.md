# OLYMPIC: Medal Prediction

## Objective
<strong>Use machine learning to predict the medals for the next Olympic</strong>

The purpose of this analysis is to predict the Medal winners for the next Olympic. We began by Analysing historic participation of countries in various events over the past century. We then applied learnings from our analysis to train different machine learning models to see how closely the models can predict the number of medals a country can win. Analysis of the dataset can provide competitive insight to all nations.
